### More informations
- **GET path = "/api/professional/all"**: brings all registered records of professionals and their specialties. If it does not find any record, it returns a `404 Not Found`, with an error message: "*No record was found!*";
- **POST path = "/api/professional/add"**: registers a new record in the database with return `201 Created` and the string "*Inserido*" with autogenerated id. If it is a `400 Bad Request`, a message "*Not allowed to insert new records with explicit ID*" is displayed.
- **PUT path = "/api/professional/edit/{id}"**: edits an existing record in the database and returns a `200 Ok` and the string "*ID [%id] updated*" , where the `%id` represents the edited ID. The registration ID is entered manually in the URL and, if it does not exist, a `404 Not Found` with the message "*It is not possible to edit, the entered ID does not exist*" is returned;
- **DELETE path = "/api/professional/delete/{id}"**: deletes an existing record from the database, returns a `200 Ok` and the string "*ID [%id] removed*" , where the `%id` represents the edited ID. The registration ID is entered manually in the URL and, if it does not exist, a `404 Not Found` with the message "*It is not possible to delete, the entered ID does not exist*" is returned;

The application.yml has been configured for the datasource to point to a h2 database and generating a log file in `./logs/speciality-app.log`.
